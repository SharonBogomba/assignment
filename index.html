                She is known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Ada Lovelace's pioneering work involved creating an algorithm intended to be processed by the Analytical Engine, making her the first to recognize
                that a machine could be used for more than just calculations.
